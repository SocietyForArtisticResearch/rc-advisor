# RC portal simulator

This is a explenation tool for portal admins.
It shows the workflow and possibilities of the portal, from the perspective of expositions.

## todo

- integrate groups
- integrate user management
- add more links to the documentation
- maybe a visual diagram for the share state 

author ) collab ) portal ) rc ) everyone

same for publication level:

archive ) limited ) unlimited

## Comments

- The author can now choose to change the visibility by sharing it:
  - share in portal
- Author may also choose to publish or submit the exposition
  - submit to portal

It might be confusing to be presented with these two possibilities in the same page.
Maybe helpful to clearly state the difference between visibility and publication?
